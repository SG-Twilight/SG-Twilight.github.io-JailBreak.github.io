<h1>It's Go Time</h1>
<p>After all, the best way to rob a bank is simply to just wear a wig and bring a neon green squirt gun, no disguise needed. People will definitely be scared enough to hand their money over to you. You park your beat up Honda Civic in front of the bank and leave the keys in the ignition, ready for a quick escape. You walk into the bank nonchalantly and then realize that the time to retrieve your money is now. Wow, you really didn't have this fully planned out, but that's okay. You decide the best method of action is to screech to get everyone's attention and then inform them that this bank is being robbed, and to give the money over to you. Your screech rings throughout the bank, and suddenly, everyone's eyes are on you. Now you're nervous and just someone in a child's princess wig standing in the middle of a random bank on a Wednesday who just screamed for no reason. You didn't realize you had a fear of public speaking.</p>
