<h1>Here Goes Nothing</h1>
<p>After an extended moment of silence and all eyes of people in the bank are on you, then you finally yell out with a severely humbling voice crack, "I'm h-HEEaR! *clears throat* S-Sorry. I'm here to r-rob you! Give me all your money and there won't be a problem." You then hold your green squirt gun into the air ineptly.</p>

<p>The people working at the bank must have sensed your lack of self-esteem in this moment, because a bald, burly security guard stands up from behind the counter with a look in his eyes that shakes you to your core. I guess the squirt gun and the Party City wig didn't do the job. He walks with heavy boots in your direction, and you then realize that this was THE worst idea that anyone could have ever come up with... seriously ever. Now it's really time to rethink career choices.</p>
