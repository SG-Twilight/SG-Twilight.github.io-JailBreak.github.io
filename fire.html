<h1>I'm Not Gonna Do This AND Be Cold At The Same Time</h1>
<p>Ahhh, yes. A cozy fire. That ought to cheer you right up, as this day has been a pile of shit worse than your wildest dreams. Luckily, you still have your Boy Scout training so you know how to make a fire. You gather what you need and spark up. Soon, you're rubbing your hands together and enjoying the pleasant warmth.</p>
<p>Suddenly, you hear a police siren and see lights shining into the trees. Police helicopters circle above with a spotlight. Not a second to rest. The cops pounce on you the moment they spot you and tell you that you're under arrest for attempted robbery AND arson. You forgot that lighting a forest fire draws attention. You go to prison for your two felonies and you're still broke.</p>
