<h1>Waiting Until The Coast Is Clear</h1>
<p>Since you're such a patient person, you made the choice to just wait in the woods until this whole situation blows over and the cops forget you tried to commit a felony. You fall asleep against a tree as the sun sets and have peaceful dreams.</p>
<p>You wake a bit later to see a figure standing in front of you. Your vision clears and you realize it's a cop, and not just one, but a whole SWAT Team.</p>
<p>"We got em' boys," one of the cops says into a walkie talkie.</p>
<p>You ask in shock, still sitting against the tree, "How did you guys find me?!"</p>
<p>The leader of the SWAT Team replies, "Dude, you literally just ran across the street into the bushes. We could see you the entire time."</p>
