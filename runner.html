<p>The clear choice was to run on foot, it's not like you need your car anyways. You didn't realize how out of shape you were until running across the street into the trees. You venture into the forest and decide to make do with where you are. You're sure the cops won't find you here. However, the sun is going down soon and you're getting hungry and cold.</p>
